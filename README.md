# Unit Conversion

This repository contains a simple unit conversion program written in C. The program allows users to convert various units of measurement, such as length, weight, and temperature, from one unit to another.

## Getting Started

To use the program, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine. Once you have the files on your computer, compile the `unit_conversion.c` file using a C compiler such as gcc. You can do this by typing the following command:

```
gcc -o unit_conversion unit_conversion.c
```

This will create an executable file named `unit_conversion`. To run the program, simply type the following command:

```
./unit_conversion
```

The program will start running and will prompt you to enter the value you want to convert, the unit you are converting from, and the unit you are converting to. Simply follow the on-screen instructions to complete the conversion.
