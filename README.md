# Unit Conversion

This repository contains a simple unit conversion program written in C. The program allows users to convert various units of measurement, such as length, weight, and temperature, from one unit to another.

## Getting Started

To use the program, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine. Once you have the files on your computer, compile the `unit_conversion.c` file using a C compiler such as gcc. You can do this by typing the following command:

```
gcc -o unit_conversion unit_conversion.c
```

This will create an executable file named `unit_conversion`. To run the program, simply type the following command:

```
